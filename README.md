This module offers gamemasters and players different ways to manage multiple actor sheets and get the most out of their
available screen real estate.

## Features

### Rolodex

The rolodex is a window that acts like a filing system or tab-based collection of other sheets. You can add sheets to
the rolodex by clicking the "Rolodex" option in the header of an actor sheet's window frame.

### Tablink

This feature provides a way to link two or more tab-based sheets together, causing all linked sheets to share the same
activate tab, regardless of which sheet you are interacting with. For example, a summoner with their character sheet and
their eidolon character sheet could use tablink to ensure both sheets track the same active tab.

## Roadmap
